# Joomla Content - Authorlinks plugin
This is the Content - Authorlinks plugin for Joomla 3.2+.

This plugin has been created as an alternative to Joomla's core **Content - Contacts** plugin. Instead of simply link the author name to the associated contact page, it let you choose to link directly to the webpage or to the email of the associated contact.

See https://github.com/mattiaverga/authorlinks/wiki for more help.
